		<h1><a style="color: #535353;" href="https://co1ncidence.github.io/posts/some-cool-scripts/">Cool Shell Scripts I&#39;ve Found Handy</a></h1>
	<b><time>09/08/2020</time></b>
	
	
	<div>
		<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve gained a bit of an obsession with shell scripting. Something about just being able to write little scripts that can do big tasks for you in little time seems very appealing to me. So in this post I&rsquo;ve compiled a few of my favorite scripts, most of which I make use of on a daily basis:</p>

	<b><time>09/06/2020</time></b>
	
	
	<div>
		For a long time now I&rsquo;ve been quite annoyed by how much of a pain it can be to do simple things with git. Even changes to your own repositories can take a while with all of the adding and committing and then typing in your credentials. Thankfully though, I have found ways to make git almost trivial to use, now I barely have to enter more than one command for most tasks, here is how I did it:

	<b><time>08/29/2020</time></b>
	
	
	
	<div>
		Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it was an &ldquo;ignorant bliss&rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&rsquo;t really know much better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I began using some of it&rsquo;s more hidden, &ldquo;power user oriented&rdquo; features, such as the built in window management and multitasking capabilities. And while I did have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early 2020.

	<b><time>08/17/2020</time></b>
	
	
	
	
	<div>
		<p>Just a list of some software I find nice to use. A lot of these correlate with <a href="https://github.com/co1ncidence?tab=stars">my stars on github</a>, so be sure to check them out as well if you want some other nice things to use. My preferences with software usually boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gets the job done</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s smaller in size than similar software</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s free and open source</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not overrated normie shit</li>
<li>And it integrates well with my workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>Now with that out of the way, here is the list:</p>

	<b><time>08/15/2020</time></b>
	
	
	
	<div>
		<p>When I first started with Linux, and especially the command line, It was difficult to find a truly optimal and comprehensive guide to everything I needed to know. While most tutorials were decent and gave me a good starting point, they usually provided insufficient information or didn&rsquo;t showcase the most optimal commands and strategies. I am making this list as more of a dump for all of the things that I have learned about Linux and the Command Line so far. While my knowledge isn&rsquo;t too much compared to some, I like to think that I know something. So without further ado, here is my guide to help boost you up in the Linux elitist ladder:</p>

	<div>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked cars and have been reading automotive journalism for many years now. While many things come into play when considering a vehicle to buy, none, in my opinion, are as important as how good your car looks. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I think are the best looking cars that I have ever seen. Expect this list to vary over time, however, since it&rsquo;s hard for me not to change my mind about these things all the time:</p>
