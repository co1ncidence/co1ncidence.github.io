		<h1><a href="https://co1ncidence.github.io/posts/some-cool-scripts/">Cool Shell Scripts I&#39;ve Found Handy</a></h1>
	<b><time>09/08/2020</time></b>
	
	
	<div>
		This post is very messy and mostly made for testing code blocks.
 Vibe: I had used mpd and ncmpcpp for my music for a long time now, but decided to switch to mpv for the simplicity, and to make things even easier, I wrote this script, which shuffles all of the music files in the chosen directory and plays them in a terminal window, with album art in it&rsquo;s own small, separate window.

	<b><time>09/06/2020</time></b>
	
	
	<div>
		For a long time now I&rsquo;ve been quite annoyed by how much of a pain it can be to do simple things with git. Even changes to your own repositories can take a while with all of the adding and committing and then typing in your credentials. Thankfully though, I have found ways to make git almost trivial to use, now I barely have to enter more than one command for most tasks, here is how I did it:

		<h1><a href="https://co1ncidence.github.io/posts/why-i-stopped-using-windows/">Why I Stopped Using Windows</a></h1>
	<b><time>08/29/2020</time></b>
	
	
	
	<div>
		Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it was an &ldquo;ignorant bliss&rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&rsquo;t really know much better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I began using some of it&rsquo;s more hidden, &ldquo;power user oriented&rdquo; features, such as the built in window management and multitasking capabilities. And while I did have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early 2020.

	<b><time>08/15/2020</time></b>
	
	
	
	<div>
		When I first started with Linux, and especially the command line, It was difficult to find a truly optimal and comprehensive guide to everything I needed to know. While most tutorials were decent and gave me a good starting point, they usually provided insufficient information or didn&rsquo;t showcase the most optimal commands and strategies. I am making this list as more of a dump for all of the things that I have learned about Linux and the Command Line so far, which isn&rsquo;t too much compared to some but I like to think that I know something.

	<div>
		Mercedes AMG GT-R One of the only cars in recent times to really pose a threat to the sales of the 911, the GT does a good job of representing a similar muscular and round look while also adhering to the aesthetic of it&rsquo;s predecessor, the SLS AMG.
Datsun 240z Fairlady One of the most well-known sports cars of it&rsquo;s time and now a JDM legend, the amount of things that have been done to the Datsun are insane, here is NightRide&rsquo;s iteration of the vehicle, one of the best looking ones I&rsquo;ve found:
