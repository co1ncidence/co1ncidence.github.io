		Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it was an &ldquo;ignorant bliss&rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&rsquo;t really know much better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I began using some of it&rsquo;s more hidden, &ldquo;power user oriented&rdquo; features, such as the built in window management and multitasking capabilities. And while I did have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early 2020.

		This is a list of some of the best software that I have come across in my journey using Linux. I highly recommend that you try them out and maybe even give the developers a well earned star on Github to show your support :)

 Maim, the better screenshot tool One of the most important pieces of software you can have is something to capture you display, while scrot does the job quite well, it has issues with selecting areas and windows, which is where Maim comes in, it does basically the same thing as scrot but without any of the rendering and selection issues.

		When I first started with Linux, and especially the command line, It was difficult to find a truly optimal and comprehensive guide to these things. While most tutorials were nice and gave me a good starting point, they usually provided inefficient information or didn&rsquo;t showcase the most optimal commands/strategies. I am making this list as more of a dump for all of the things that I have learned about bash so far, which isn&rsquo;t too much compared to some but I like to think that I know something.

		Mercedes AMG GT-R One of the only cars in recent times to really pose a threat to the sales of the 911, the GT does a good job of representing a similar muscular and round look while also adhering to the aesthetic of it&rsquo;s predecessor, the SLS AMG.
Datsun 240z Fairlady One of the most well-known sports cars of it&rsquo;s time and now a JDM legend, the amount of things that have been done to the Datsun are insane, here is NightRide&rsquo;s iteration of the vehicle, one of the best looking ones I&rsquo;ve found:
