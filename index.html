		For a long time now I&rsquo;ve been quite annoyed by how much of a pain it can be to do simple things with git. Even changes to your own repositories can take a while with all of the adding and committing and then typing in your credentials. Thankfully though, I have found ways to make git almost trivial to use, now I barely have to enter more than one command for most tasks, here is how I did it:

		Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it was an &ldquo;ignorant bliss&rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&rsquo;t really know much better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I began using some of it&rsquo;s more hidden, &ldquo;power user oriented&rdquo; features, such as the built in window management and multitasking capabilities. And while I did have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early 2020.

		Just a list of some software I find nice to use, most are pretty minimal as well:
 cfm - Simple and fast terminal file manager
maim - extremely powerful CLI screenshot tool
SXIV - &ldquo;Simple X Image Viewer&rdquo;
giph - Customizable and easy to use GIF recorder
birch - Freenode IRC client written in bash
farge - Finally a lightweight CLI colorpicker
ungoogled-chromium - Browse safely and privately, no compromises

		When I first started with Linux, and especially the command line, It was difficult to find a truly optimal and comprehensive guide to these things. While most tutorials were nice and gave me a good starting point, they usually provided inefficient information or didn&rsquo;t showcase the most optimal commands/strategies. I am making this list as more of a dump for all of the things that I have learned about bash so far, which isn&rsquo;t too much compared to some but I like to think that I know something.

		Mercedes AMG GT-R One of the only cars in recent times to really pose a threat to the sales of the 911, the GT does a good job of representing a similar muscular and round look while also adhering to the aesthetic of it&rsquo;s predecessor, the SLS AMG.
Datsun 240z Fairlady One of the most well-known sports cars of it&rsquo;s time and now a JDM legend, the amount of things that have been done to the Datsun are insane, here is NightRide&rsquo;s iteration of the vehicle, one of the best looking ones I&rsquo;ve found:
