		<p>One of the things I find most important when using a computer is effective workflow management. Getting the most efficient setup and being able to do my work as fast as possible while maintaining quality. In this post I will go over some of the things I do in my setup to ensure that I have the most efficient working environment possible</p>

		<p>Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it
was an &ldquo;ignorant bliss&rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&rsquo;t really know much
better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I started using
some of it&rsquo;s slightly less obvious, &ldquo;power user&rdquo; oriented features, such as the
built in window management and multitasking capabilities. However, while I did
have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early
2020.</p>

		<p>For a long time now I&rsquo;ve been quite annoyed by how much of a pain it can be to do simple things with git. Even changes to your own repositories can take a while with all of the adding and committing and then typing in your credentials. Thankfully though, I have found ways to make git almost trivial to use, now I barely have to enter more than one command for most tasks, here is how I did it:</p>

		<p>When I first started with Linux, and especially the command line, It was difficult to find a truly optimal and comprehensive guide to everything I needed to know. While most tutorials were decent and gave me a good starting point, they usually provided insufficient information or didn&rsquo;t showcase the most optimal commands and strategies. I am making this list as more of a dump for all of the things that I have learned about Linux and the Command Line so far. While my knowledge isn&rsquo;t too much compared to some, I like to think that I know something. So without further ado, here is my guide to help boost you up in the Linux elitist ladder:</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked cars and have been reading automotive journalism for many years now. While many things come into play when considering a vehicle to buy, none, in my opinion, are as important as how good your car looks. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I think are the best looking cars that I have ever seen. Expect this list to vary over time, however, since it&rsquo;s hard for me not to change my mind about these things all the time:</p>
