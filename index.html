					<span class="description">
						
						8. De Tomaso Pantera, While some may find the more exotic &ldquo;GTS&rdquo; variant of the Pantera to be the one that looks better, I&rsquo;m not personally a fan of the Lamborghini Countach-like aesthetic of that vehicle. I much prefer the cleaner, sharper look of the Pantera, it is definitely a piece of art to behold.
7. BMW M3 (e30), Couldn&rsquo;t have a list like this without the legend itself.
6. Koenigsegg Agera R, I&rsquo;ve always had a thing for more muscular looking cars, but the style that real muscle cars have doesn&rsquo;t really hit the spot I want it to.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						Above you can see a pretty complete screenshot of my openbox rice. I like to go for a kinda comfy, retro feels with my rices and like to avoid too many vivid colors. My polybar is also kept to a minimal, as to keep my (fairly) weak laptop from being under too much stress. One of my main goals with this rice was to minimize resource usage. I managed to accomplish this very well, with my ram usage after a fresh boot and with mpd running being only 280mb.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						As someone who&rsquo;s always given a lot of importance to the concept of a streamlined workflow, I&rsquo;ve always been on the lookout for the best possible tools for what I do. One of the most important tools someone like me can use is the Text Editor. There are many popular Editors and IDE&rsquo;s out there, and I have tried many of them. For the better part of the last year I have been &ldquo;Editor Hopping&rdquo; in search of something to replace what I used to use, which was Apache&rsquo;s NetBeans IDE.&hellip;
