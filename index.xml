      <title>Top 8 Best Looking Cars, In My Opinion</title>

      <description>8. De Tomaso Pantera, While some may find the more exotic &amp;ldquo;GTS&amp;rdquo; variant of the Pantera to be the one that looks better, I&amp;rsquo;m not personally a fan of the Lamborghini Countach-like aesthetic of that vehicle. I much prefer the cleaner, sharper look of the Pantera, it is definitely a piece of art to behold.
7. BMW M3 (e30), Couldn&amp;rsquo;t have a list like this without the legend itself.
6. Koenigsegg Agera R, I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a thing for more muscular looking cars, but the style that real muscle cars have doesn&amp;rsquo;t really hit the spot I want it to.</description>

      <description>Above you can see a pretty complete screenshot of my openbox rice. I like to go for a kinda comfy, retro feels with my rices and like to avoid too many vivid colors. My polybar is also kept to a minimal, as to keep my (fairly) weak laptop from being under too much stress. One of my main goals with this rice was to minimize resource usage. I managed to accomplish this very well, with my ram usage after a fresh boot and with mpd running being only 280mb.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just a bored windrunner looking for fun stuff to do over the summer. I consider myself a Linux enthusiast and a veteran ricer, I take customization very seriously and have worked quite a bit to perfect my workflow. I am also an avid anti-normie and believe that everyone should care more about their online presence and what sorts of software they use. And, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already guessed, I am a huge advocate of FOSS.</description>

      <title>Why I Use Neovim And Not A Normal Editor</title>

      <description>As someone who&amp;rsquo;s always given a lot of importance to the concept of a streamlined workflow, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the lookout for the best possible tools for what I do. One of the most important tools someone like me can use is the Text Editor. There are many popular Editors and IDE&amp;rsquo;s out there, and I have tried many of them. For the better part of the last year I have been &amp;ldquo;Editor Hopping&amp;rdquo; in search of something to replace what I used to use, which was Apache&amp;rsquo;s NetBeans IDE.</description>
