      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I find most important when using a computer is effective workflow management. Getting the most efficient setup and being able to do my work as fast as possible while maintaining quality. In this post I will go over some of the things I do in my setup to ensure that I have the most efficient working environment possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making Git Pushes Less Annoying</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite annoyed by how much of a pain it can be to do simple things with git. Even changes to your own repositories can take a while with all of the adding and committing and then typing in your credentials. Thankfully though, I have found ways to make git almost trivial to use, now I barely have to enter more than one command for most tasks, here is how I did it:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Stopped Using Windows</title>
      <link>https://co1ncidence.github.io/posts/why-i-stopped-using-windows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it was an &amp;ldquo;ignorant bliss&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know much better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I began using some of it&amp;rsquo;s more hidden, &amp;ldquo;power user oriented&amp;rdquo; features, such as the built in window management and multitasking capabilities. And while I did have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a list of some software I find nice to use. A lot of these correlate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/co1ncidence?tab=stars&#34;&gt;my stars on github&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to check them out as well if you want some other nice things to use. My preferences with software usually boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets the job done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s smaller in size than similar software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s free and open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not overrated normie shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it integrates well with my workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with that out of the way, here is the list:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linux and CLI, a 101</title>
      <link>https://co1ncidence.github.io/posts/linux-and-cli-a-101/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started with Linux, and especially the command line, It was difficult to find a truly optimal and comprehensive guide to everything I needed to know. While most tutorials were decent and gave me a good starting point, they usually provided insufficient information or didn&amp;rsquo;t showcase the most optimal commands and strategies. I am making this list as more of a dump for all of the things that I have learned about Linux and the Command Line so far. While my knowledge isn&amp;rsquo;t too much compared to some, I like to think that I know something. So without further ado, here is my guide to help boost you up in the Linux elitist ladder:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Top 10 Best Looking Cars</title>
      <link>https://co1ncidence.github.io/posts/top-10-best-looking-cars/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked cars and have been reading automotive journalism for many years now. While many things come into play when considering a vehicle to buy, none, in my opinion, are as important as how good your car looks. So I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I think are the best looking cars that I have ever seen. Expect this list to vary over time, however, since it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me not to change my mind about these things all the time:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just a lost windrunner who spends too much of my wasting it, mostly due to my obsession with Linux, ricing, and Open Source. Though of course, the blame all goes to a good peach and some chocolate covered almonds, nothing wastes time like those do.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of the Fjords of Norway but recently discovered the beauty of places like Iceland and Baffin Island, both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive.</description>

      <description>Here are all most of the Rices that I have made on my computer over the last few months, some are pretty similar to each other but I put them in here anyway. If you would like to try some of my configs for yourself, visit my dotless files repository.
