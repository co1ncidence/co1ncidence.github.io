Just a list of some software I find nice to use. A lot of these correlate with [my stars on github](https://github.com/co1ncidence?tab=stars), so be sure to check them out as well if you want some other nice things to use. My preferences with software usually boil down to:
  - It gets the job done
  - It's smaller in size than similar software
  - It's free and open source
  - It's not overrated normie shit
  - And it integrates well with my workflow

Now with that out of the way, here is the list:
