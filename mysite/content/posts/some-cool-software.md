This is a list of some of the best software that I have come across in my journey using Linux. I highly recommend that you try them out and maybe even give the developers a well earned star on Github to show your support :) I've divided the software into sections based on their uses, so if you don't see what you need just scroll down until you see the type of software you are searching for.

> Links to the software's Github page are in the headers

### [Maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim), the better screenshot tool
One of the most important pieces of software you can have is something to capture you display, while [scrot](https://github.com/dreamer/scrot) does the job quite well, it has issues with selecting areas and windows, which is where Maim comes in, it does basically the same thing as scrot but without any of the rendering and selection issues. Fun fact, every screenshot you see on this blog was taken using Maim.

> fun fact, bind this command in your hotkey daemon's config and you can use it to easily take and paste screenshots:

> `maim -s -u | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png`

### [SXIV](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv), the image viewer that, well, views images
While most desktop environments do come with their own image viewers, most of them, like the Eye Of Gnome image viewer, are unnecessarily bloated and have unneeded features. This is where SXIV comes in, it follows exactly what its name says it is. I views images in a small window with a statusbar. You can zoom in and out and even view folders of images in a thumbnail view. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to move to using smaller, faster, more efficient software.

### [Giph](https://github.com/phisch/giph), easily record gifs of your screen

### [Ripcord](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/), an dangerously lightweight and minimal Discord/Slack client

### [Lyrebird](https://github.com/chxrlt/lyrebird), Simple and easy to use Voice Changer for Linux
Just looking at the UI of this program, you can easily tell what it is. You simply select which effect to apply then toggle the application, it couldn't possibly get simpler to use. It works really good too, with there being minimal to none amounts of audible distortion and/or lag in input time when using this to change your voice.

### [CFM], A terminal file manager that makes sense
