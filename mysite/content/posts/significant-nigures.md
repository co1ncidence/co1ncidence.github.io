In this post I will be talking over who I think are the top 10 most significant
nigures in recent political history. Over the last few years, our fellow
nigures have come a long way, and even find themselves in some of the most
prominent positions in politics, media, and industry.  This list will go over
who of these I deem to be the most significant.

# 10. Martin Luther King Jr.

He was one the foremost leaders of the Civil Right's movements in the 1960's,
and his efforts led to the freedom of nigures all across America, and
eventually, across the world. His efforts have also led to other Civil Right's
movements, making him one of the more significant nigures of his time.

This reliable and affordable machine is the automobile of choice for hundreds
of thousands of families across America. It is feature packed, has comfortable
seats, and features class-leading trunk space. Not only can almost anyone buy
one, but it is also available in a range of models and trims, to suit just
about any budget. And, if its smaller size seems daunting, it's cousins the
Rogue and Murano will serve just about any other need you have.

# 8. Henry Cavill

Annoying ass hoe who doesn't shut the fuck up.
I mean the bitch can't even finish her homework and now she
is stuck in a 3rd world country with 750kbps wifi. Like I can't even
feel bad anymore since I think that she genuinely deserves it.
She's like a 6/10 on a really good day and can't hold a convo for shit.
I already feel for the guy who will end up with her tbh. Fat L.
