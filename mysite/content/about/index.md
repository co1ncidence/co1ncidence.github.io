I'm just a bored windrunner looking for fun stuff to do over the summer. I consider myself a Linux enthusiast and a veteran ricer, I take customization very seriously and have worked quite a bit to perfect my workflow. I am also an avid anti-normie and believe that everyone should care more about their online presence and what sorts of software they use. And, if you haven't already guessed, I am also a huge advocate of FOSS.

### My Stuff:
Here is a sneak-peak at my current rice:

Recently I've been going for a bit of a more comfy, low contrast feel on my laptop rice, mostly to have a nice environment for studying and because I've gotten tired of higher contrast color palettes.

Oh, and if you're wondering what my bash prompt is, it's simple my home directory with a space after, here is the code:
```bash
PS1='\[\e[0;37m\]\w\[\e[m\] \[\e0'
```
I'll be making more posts on my configuration(s) later, so stay tuned!
