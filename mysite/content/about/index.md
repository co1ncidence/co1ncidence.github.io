Just a lost windrunner who spends too much of my wasting it, mostly due to my obsession with Linux and ricing. Along with, of course, a good peach and chocolate covered almonds, nothing wastes time like those do.

I've always been a fan of the [Fjords of Norway](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fjords+of+norway&iax=images&ia=images) but recently discovered the beauty of places like [Iceland](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iceland+mountains&iax=images&ia=images) and [Baffin Island](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baffin+island&iax=images&ia=images), both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive.

Gaming was a big thing for me a while ago but I find it kind of meh now, I've come to prefer doing more productive things, though I will admit that some [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) or [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) from time to time is a nice getaway.

I'm the kind of guy who eats grapes straight from the vine and will use the smallest spoon available when eating something he likes. I don't know if that says anything about me but I hope it does. I learn by teaching and teach by scolding, it's worked for me so far and I hope it keeps doing so.

I haven't met Money in a while now, she doesn't exactly get along well with me, but that's fine, Loneliness was always more my type.
