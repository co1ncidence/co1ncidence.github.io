I'm just a lost windrunner who spends too much of his time, well, wasting it.
Most of what I do in those moments ends up leaving me with fewer and fewer
friends as the days go by.  But it's fine, it's all for the greater good, isn't
it?  Anyhow, you'll find out plenty about happens in those hours on this
website anyway, so no need to talk about it here.

I've always been a fan of the [Fjords of
Norway](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fjords+of+norway&iax=images&ia=images) but
recently discovered the beauty of places like
[Iceland](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iceland+mountains&iax=images&ia=images) and
[Baffin Island](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baffin+island&iax=images&ia=images),
both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive, not like I'll be
able to afford it anyway but a guy can dream.

Gaming was a big thing for me a while ago but I find it kind of tiring now,
I've come to prefer ~~procrastinating in other ways~~ doing more productive
things, though I will admit that some [Hollow
Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) or
[Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) from time to
time is a nice getaway.

I'm the kind of guy who eats grapes straight from the vine and will use the
smallest spoon he has when eating something he likes (I'm pretty sure that last
sentence was poetic enough to make sense).  I learn by teaching and teach by
scolding, it's worked for me so far and I'm sure it'll keep doing so.

I haven't met Money in a while now, she doesn't exactly get along well with me,
but that's fine, Loneliness was always more my type.
