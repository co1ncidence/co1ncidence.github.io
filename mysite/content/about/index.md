I'm just a bored windrunner looking for fun stuff to do over the summer. I consider myself a Linux enthusiast and a veteran ricer, I take customization very seriously and have worked quite a bit to perfect my workflow. I am also an avid anti-normie and believe that everyone should care more about their online presence and what sorts of software they use. And, if you haven't already guessed, I am a huge advocate of FOSS. I've been a car guy for a lot of my life but am not really good at talking about them (since I've never driven one), so don't expect too many car related posts. I'm an avid gamer and former a Semi-Pro CS:GO player, though due to schoolwork and other concerns I have stopped playing competitively for the time being. And, being a longtime fantasy lover, here are some books from the genre that I think you should read:
