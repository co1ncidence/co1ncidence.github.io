Just a lost windrunner who spends too much his time wasting it, mostly due to my obsession with Linux and ricing. Along with, of course, a good peach and chocolate covered almonds, nothing wastes time like those do.

I've always been a fan of the [Fjords of Norway](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fjords+of+norway&iax=images&ia=images) but recently discovered the beauty of places like [Iceland](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iceland+mountains&iax=images&ia=images) and [Baffin Island](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baffin+island&iax=images&ia=images), both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive.

Gaming was a big thing for me a while ago but it's kinda meh now, I prefer doing more productive things, though some [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) or [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) from time to time is a nice getaway.

My favorite food is a bit of a touchy topic. I usually can't decide but I *have* been craving some nice [Mutton Nihari](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mutton+nihari&ia=images&iax=images) lately...

I haven't met Money in a while now, we don't exactly get along together, but I do 7 month old cat named Felix whom I consider to be my best friend. Quarantine has got me stuck at home but I manage to find things to do, some of which you might read about on here.

That's enough of an introduction for now I guess, I look forward to seeing you around.
