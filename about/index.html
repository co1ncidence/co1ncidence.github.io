			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<div>
				

<p>I&rsquo;m just a lost windrunner who spends too much of his time, well, wasting it.
Most of what I do in those moments ends up leaving me with fewer and fewer
friends as the days go by.  But it&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s all for the greater good, isn&rsquo;t
it?  Anyhow, you&rsquo;ll find out plenty about happens in those hours on this
website anyway, so no need to talk about it here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fjords+of+norway&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Fjords of
Norway</a> but
recently discovered the beauty of places like
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iceland+mountains&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Iceland</a> and
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baffin+island&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Baffin Island</a>,
both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive, not like I&rsquo;ll be
able to afford it anyway but a guy can dream.</p>

<p>Gaming was a big thing for me a while ago but I find it kind of tiring now,
I&rsquo;ve come to prefer <del>procrastinating in other ways</del> doing more productive
things, though I will admit that some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/">Hollow
Knight</a> or
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Terraria</a> from time to
time is a nice getaway.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the kind of guy who eats grapes straight from the vine and will use the
smallest spoon he has when eating something he likes (I&rsquo;m pretty sure that last
sentence was poetic enough to make sense).  I learn by teaching and teach by
scolding, it&rsquo;s worked for me so far and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll keep doing so.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t met Money in a while now, she doesn&rsquo;t exactly get along well with me,
but that&rsquo;s fine, Loneliness was always more my type.</p>
