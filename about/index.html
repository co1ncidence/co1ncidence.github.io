    <p>Just a lost windrunner who spends too much time wasting it. A large part of which is my obsession with Linux and ricing. Along with, of course, a good peach and chocolate covered almonds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fjords+of+norway&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Fjords of Norway</a> but recently discovered the beauty of places like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iceland+mountains&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Iceland</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baffin+island&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Baffin Island</a>, both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive.</p>
<p>Gaming was a thing for me a while ago but it&rsquo;s kinda meh now, I prefer doing more productive things, though some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/">Hollow Knight</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Terraria</a> from time to time is a nice getaway.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my favorite food? Well, this is a bit of a touchy topic. I usually can&rsquo;t decide but I <em>have</em> been craving some nice <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mutton+nihari&amp;ia=images&amp;iax=images">Mutton Nihari</a> lately&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see money that often, and my best friend is a 7 month old cat named Felix. Quarantine has got me stuck at home but I manage to find things to do, you&rsquo;ll be reading about said things quite often here. See you around :P</p>
