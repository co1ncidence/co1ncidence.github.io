			<p>I&rsquo;m just a bored windrunner looking for fun stuff to do over the summer. I consider myself a Linux enthusiast and a veteran ricer, I take customization very seriously and have worked quite a bit to perfect my workflow. I am also an avid anti-normie and believe that everyone should care more about their online presence and what sorts of software they use. And, if you haven&rsquo;t already guessed, I am a huge advocate of FOSS. I&rsquo;ve been a car guy for a lot of my life but am not really good at talking about them (since I&rsquo;ve never driven one), so don&rsquo;t expect too many car related posts. I&rsquo;m an avid gamer and former a Semi-Pro CS:GO player, though due to schoolwork and other concerns I have stopped playing competitively for the time being. And I am, of course, a longtime lover of fantasy.</p>
