      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, a confession, I used to really like Windows, I admit that it was an &amp;ldquo;ignorant bliss&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, but back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know much better. I used it often and started liking it even more when I began using some of it&amp;rsquo;s more hidden, &amp;ldquo;power user oriented&amp;rdquo; features, such as the built in window management and multitasking capabilities. And while I did have quite a good time in my years using Windows, reality dawned on me in early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a list of some software I find nice to use. A lot of these correlate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/co1ncidence?tab=stars&#34;&gt;my stars on github&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to check them out as well if you want some other nice things to use. My preferences with software usually boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets the job done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s smaller in size than similar software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s free and open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not overrated normie shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it integrates well with my workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with that out of the way, here is the list:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Top 10 Best Looking Cars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked cars and have been reading automotive journalism for many years now. While many things come into play when considering a vehicle to buy, none, in my opinion, are as important as how good your car looks. So I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I think are the best looking cars that I have ever seen. Expect this list to vary over time, however, since it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me not to change my mind about these things all the time:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
