      <title>A Few of My Favorite Monospaced Fonts</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a bit of an exaggerated font collection, most likely because I could never really decide on a single one. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided instead to make a list of all the ones that I (semi-regularly) switch around between. These screenshots are taken using the alacritty terminal at 800px width and 11px font size. This consistency allows for easier distinction between the line spacing and font size differences seen here. I have also nudged the line height by a bit to make the screenshots appear a bit less crowded.</description>

      <description>Here are all most of the Rices that I have made on my computer over the last few months, some are pretty similar to each other but I put them in here anyway. If you would like to try some of my configs for yourself, visit my dotless files repository.
