      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a bit of an exaggerated font collection, most likely because I could never really decide on a single one. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided instead to make a list of all the ones that I (semi-regularly) switch around between. These screenshots are taken using the alacritty terminal at 800px width and 11px font size. This consistency allows for easier distinction between the line spacing and font size differences seen here. I have also nudged the line height by a bit to make the screenshots appear a bit less crowded.</description>
