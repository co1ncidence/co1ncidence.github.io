      <description>This post is very messy and mostly made for testing code blocks.
 Vibe: I had used mpd and ncmpcpp for my music for a long time now, but decided to switch to mpv for the simplicity, and to make things even easier, I wrote this script, which shuffles all of the music files in the chosen directory and plays them in a terminal window, with album art in it&amp;rsquo;s own small, separate window.</description>

      <description>Here are all most of the Rices that I have made on my computer over the last few months, some are pretty similar to each other but I put them in here anyway. If you would like to try some of my configs for yourself, visit my dotless files repository.
