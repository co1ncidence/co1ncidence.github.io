      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve gained a bit of an obsession with shell scripting. Something about just being able to write little scripts that can do big tasks for you in little time seems very appealing to me. So in this post I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a few of my favorite scripts, most of which I make use of on a daily basis:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a list of some software I find nice to use. A lot of these correlate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/co1ncidence?tab=stars&#34;&gt;my stars on github&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to check them out as well if you want some other nice things to use. My preferences with software usually boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets the job done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s smaller in size than similar software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s free and open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not overrated normie shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it integrates well with my workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with that out of the way, here are some of my software faves:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Here are all most of the Rices that I have made on my computer over the last few months, some are pretty similar to each other but I put them in here anyway. If you would like to try some of my configs for yourself, visit my dotless files repository.
