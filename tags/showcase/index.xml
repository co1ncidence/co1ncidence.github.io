      <title>A Few of My Favorite Monospaced Fonts</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a bit of an exaggerated font collection, most likely because I could never really decide on a single one. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided instead to make a list of all the ones that I (semi-regularly) switch around between. These screenshots are taken using the alacritty terminal at 800px width and 11px font size. This consistency allows for easier distinction between the line spacing and font size differences seen here. I have also nudged the line height by a bit to make the screenshots appear a bit less crowded.</description>

      <description>This post will most likely get updated as time goes by
 Vibe: I had used mpd and ncmpcpp for my music for a long time now, but decided to switch to mpv for the simplicity, and to make things even easier, I wrote this script, which shuffles all of the music files in the chosen directory and plays them in a terminal window, with album art in it&amp;rsquo;s own small, separate window.</description>

      <description>Here are all most of the Rices that I have made on my computer over the last few months, some are pretty similar to each other but I put them in here anyway. If you would like to try some of my configs for yourself, visit my dotless files repository.
