			<h1>Top 10 Most Significant Nigures</h1>
			<div>
				

<p>In this post I will be talking over who I think are the top 10 most significant
nigures in recent political history. Over the last few years, our fellow
nigures have come a long way, and even find themselves in some of the most
prominent positions in politics, media, and industry.  This list will go over
who of these I deem to be the most significant.</p>

<h1 id="10-martin-luther-king-jr">10. Martin Luther King Jr.</h1>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KzHJYx1Q/image.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>He was one the foremost leaders of the Civil Right&rsquo;s movements in the 1960&rsquo;s,
and his efforts led to the freedom of nigures all across America, and
eventually, across the world. His efforts have also led to other Civil Right&rsquo;s
movements, making him one of the more significant nigures of his time.</p>

<h1 id="9-2014-nissan-altima-sv">9. 2014 Nissan Altima SV</h1>

<p>This reliable and affordable machine is the automobile of choice for hundreds
of thousands of families across America. It is feature packed, has comfortable
seats, and features class-leading trunk space. Not only can almost anyone buy
one, but it is also available in a range of models and trims, to suit just
about any budget. And, if its smaller size seems daunting, it&rsquo;s cousins the
Rogue and Murano will serve just about any other need you have.</p>

<p>Annoying ass hoe who doesn&rsquo;t shut the fuck up.
I mean the bitch can&rsquo;t even finish her homework and now she
is stuck in a 3rd world country with 750kbps wifi. Like I can&rsquo;t even
feel bad anymore since I think that she genuinely deserves it.
She&rsquo;s like a <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on a really good day and can&rsquo;t hold a convo for shit.
I already feel for the guy who will end up with her tbh. Fat L.</p>
