<p>While some may find the more exotic &ldquo;GTS&rdquo; variant of the Pantera to be the one that looks better, I&rsquo;m not personally a fan of the Lamborghini Countach-like aesthetic of that vehicle. I much prefer the cleaner, sharper look of the Pantera, it is definitely a piece of art to behold.</p>

<h2 id="7-bmw-m3-e30">7. BMW M3 (e30),</h2>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have a list like this without the legend itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Fwww.motoringresearch.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F03%2FBMW-E30-M3-Redux-001.jpg%3Fresize%3D1500%252C844%26ssl%3D1&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="6-koenigsegg-agera-r">6. Koenigsegg Agera R,</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a thing for more muscular looking cars, but the style that real muscle cars have doesn&rsquo;t really hit the spot I want it to. The way Koenigsegg designed the Agera, however, matches perfectly with what I mean. Long, sleek lines with a short hood and flat buttresses really make this car stand out in the upper echelon of the supercar industry.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oVeyjg0.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="5-porsche-911-carrera-992">5. Porsche 911 Carrera (992),</h2>
<p>Now while people usually consider the design of the Porsche 911 to be quite bland and repetitive, I quite like the planted, wide feel the design of the new 992 Carrera brings to the table, and though it&rsquo;s basically the same as the last generation, the new headlights are the reason I chose this one over the 991.2.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1MvCnm4.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="4-mclaren-765lt">4. Mclaren 765LT,</h2>
<p>I was originally going to add the Mclaren 720s to take this place. But with the recent announcement that Mclaren&rsquo;s next speedtail was going to be based off of the 720, I just had to use this one instead as it only improves on the beautiful design of its predecessor.</p>

<h2 id="3-acura-nsx-gen-1">3. Acura Nsx (Gen 1),</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much to say about this car, just that it looks nice for it&rsquo;s time and has managed to employ a quite timeless aesthetic. Too bad it&rsquo;s successor didn&rsquo;t achieve the same.</p>

<h2 id="2-ferrari-250swb">2. Ferrari 250SWB,</h2>
<p>A spin-off model of what was arguably one of the best looking Ferraris of all time, the 250SWB improves greatly on the vintage aesthetic of the 250GTO and manages to look even more sophisticated than its older brother.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3nE0VdI.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="1-aston-martin-dbs-superleggera">1. Aston Martin DBS Superleggera,</h2>
<p>I Don&rsquo;t think that there even really is any question as to why I chose the Superleggera as the number one entry in my list.</p>
