				<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked cars and have been reading automotive journalism for many years now. While many things come into play when considering a vehicle to buy, none, in my opinion, are as important as how good your car looks. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I think are the best looking cars that I have ever seen. Expect this list to vary over time, however, since it&rsquo;s hard for me not to change my mind about these things all the time:</p>
<h2 id="mercedes-amg-gt-r">Mercedes AMG GT-R</h2>
<p>One of the only cars in recent times to really pose a threat to the sales of the 911, the GT does a good job of representing a similar muscular and round look while also adhering to the aesthetic of it&rsquo;s predecessor, the SLS AMG.</p>

<h2 id="datsun-240z-fairlady">Datsun 240z Fairlady</h2>
<p>One of the most well-known sports cars of it&rsquo;s time and now a JDM legend, the amount of things that have been done to the Datsun are insane, here is NightRide&rsquo;s iteration of the vehicle, one of the best looking ones I&rsquo;ve found:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XXhE6B9.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="de-tomaso-pantera">De Tomaso Pantera</h2>
<p>While some may find the more exotic &ldquo;GTS&rdquo; variant of the Pantera to be the one that looks better, I&rsquo;m not personally a fan of the Lamborghini Countach-like aesthetic of that vehicle. I much prefer the cleaner, sharper look of the Pantera, it is definitely a piece of art to behold.</p>

<h2 id="bmw-m3">BMW M3</h2>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have a list like this without the legend itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BsUufV0.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="koenigsegg-one1">Koenigsegg One:1</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a thing for more muscular looking cars, but the style that real muscle cars have doesn&rsquo;t really hit the spot I want it to. The way Koenigsegg designed the One:1, however, matches perfectly with what I mean. Long, sleek lines with a short hood and flat buttresses really make this car stand out in the upper echelon of the hypercar scene. The fact that it is one of the fastest cars in the world also helps its case.</p>

<h2 id="porsche-911-carrera">Porsche 911 Carrera</h2>
<p>Now while people usually consider the design of the Porsche 911 to be quite bland and repetitive, I quite like the planted, wide feel the design of the new 992 Carrera brings to the table, and though it&rsquo;s basically the same as the last generation, the new headlights are the reason I chose this one over the 991.2.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1MvCnm4.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="mclaren-765lt">Mclaren 765LT</h2>
<p>I was originally going to add the Mclaren 720s to take this place. But with the recent announcement that Mclaren&rsquo;s next speedtail was going to be based off of the 720, I just had to use this one instead as it only improves on the beautiful design of its predecessor.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F2c5TVc.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="acura-nsx">Acura NSX</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much to say about this car, just that it looks nice for it&rsquo;s time and has managed to employ a quite timeless aesthetic. Too bad it&rsquo;s successor didn&rsquo;t achieve the same.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HyupsoV.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="ferrari-250swb">Ferrari 250SWB</h2>
<p>A spin-off model of what was arguably one of the best looking Ferraris of all time, the 250SWB improves greatly on the vintage aesthetic of the 250GTO and manages to look even more sophisticated than its older brother.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3nE0VdI.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="aston-martin-dbs-superleggera">Aston Martin DBS Superleggera</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best looking, no argument here.</p>
