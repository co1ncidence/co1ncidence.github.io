			<h1>Making Git Pushes Less Annoying</h1>
			<div>
				<p>For a long time now I&rsquo;ve been quite annoyed by how much of a pain it can be to
do simple things with git. Even changes to your own repositories can take a
while with all of the adding and committing and then typing in your
credentials. Thankfully though, I have found ways to make git almost trivial to
use, now I barely have to enter more than one command for most tasks, here is
how I did it:</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="make-a-push-script">Make A Push Script</h2>

<p>Normally when you push a newly modified repository, you would need to do 3 or 4
different commands, I&rsquo;ve found it much easier to just make a shell script like
this and then place it in my <code>$PATH</code> for easy usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh

[ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \
    msg=&quot;docs:update&quot; || \
    msg=&quot;$1&quot;

git add .
git commit -m &quot;${msg}&quot;
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>This script will stage all of the files in your current git directory for a
commit, and use whatever argument you pass after it as the commit message. If
you don&rsquo;t give any message to the script, it will use <code>docs:update</code> and push
with that.</p>

<h2 id="make-git-stop-asking-for-usernames-passwords">Make Git Stop Asking For Usernames/Passwords</h2>

<p>Another annoying thing that occurs when pushing repositories is that git always
asks you for your username and password, which can get very tedious after a
while. Fortunately, <code>git config</code> has a built in system to override this. First,
you have to set your default github url to that of your username with this
command, just replace <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> with your git username:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git config --global url.&quot;https://&lt;username&gt;@github.com&quot;.insteadOf &quot;https://github.com&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This will make git remember who you are and not ask for your username anymore.
Now for your password, there is no real way to <em>never type your password</em>, but
you can extend the sudo-like wait period that git has with this command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=28800'
</code></pre>

<p>This will make git not ask for your password again for 28,800 seconds, which is
roughly 8 hours. You can, of course, adjust this time to suit your needs. After
all of this is done, your git config file, usually <code>~/.gitconfig</code> will look
something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[user]
    email = &quot;r3yan.chaudhry@zohomail.com&quot;
    name = &quot;co1ncidence&quot;
  [url &quot;https://co1ncidence@github.com&quot;]
    insteadOf = &quot;https://github.com&quot;
  [credential]
    helper = &quot;cache --timeout=28800&quot;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>There you go! This will hopefully make a lot of your smaller tasks with git a great deal easier.</strong></p>
