				<p>Often when working with limits, you will come across a situation in which
your limit, when solved by using simple substitution,
ends up being an <em>indeterminate form</em>. An example of this is when
attempting to compute the following:</p>
<p>$$ \lim\limits_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} $$</p>
<p>If you tried solving this limit in the normal fashion,
by simply plugging in 0 for every time $ x $ appears,
you would get a strange answer:</p>
<p>$$ f(x) = \frac{\sin(0)}{0} \implies \frac{0}{0} $$</p>
<p>As you can see, our answer is (decidedly) indeterminate.
What does this mean?
An answer like the above usually means that while your
function <em>may</em> have a limit at the desired point,
it is not defined, which is why we get null as our
limit value when trying to plug it in.</p>
<p>What can we do in such a situation?
Since we don&rsquo;t have a graph available to us,
we don&rsquo;t have the option to try and solve this visually,
like we normally would.
Fortunately, there is a rule which comes in quite
handy when dealing with indeterminate forms.
L&rsquo;Hopital&rsquo;s rule, which has been used for centuries
to solve this paradox, states the following:</p>
<p>$$ \lim\limits_{x \to y} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim\limits_{x \to y} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} $$</p>
<p>Basically, when given a quotient comprised of two functions, $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $, you can find
their combined limits by dividing their respective derivatives by each other.
Let&rsquo;s test this on our previously used example,
beginning by turning $ \sin(x) $ into it&rsquo;s derivative $ \cos(x) $:</p>
<p>$$ \lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \implies \frac{\cos(x)}{1} $$</p>
<p align="center">The derivative of $ x $ is always 1.</p>
<p>$$ f(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{1} = 1 $$</p>
<p align="center">Since $ \cos $ is continuous, we are left with $ cos(0) $.</p>
<p>As you can see, if we use L&rsquo;Hopital&rsquo;s rule, we can find the limit at 0 of $ \frac{\sin(x)}{x} $,
even though the function is not defined at that point, without using a graph.
It is important, however, to only use this rule if you know <em>for sure</em> that the
expression you are trying to solve for the limit of is an indeterminate form,
since it only works in those specific cases.</p>
<p><strong>If you haven&rsquo;t realized, this post was just a test run for my mathjax config lmao,
hope you enjoyed anyway though.</strong></p>
