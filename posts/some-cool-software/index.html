    <p>This is a list of some of the best software that I have come across in my journey using Linux. I highly recommend that you try them out and maybe even give the developers a well earned star on Github to show your support :) I&rsquo;ve divided the software into sections based on their uses, so if you don&rsquo;t see what you need just scroll down until you see the type of software you are searching for.</p>

<p>Links to the software&rsquo;s Github page are in the headers</p>

<h3 id="maimhttpsgithubcomnaelstrofmaim-the-better-screenshot-tool"><a href="https://github.com/naelstrof/maim">Maim</a>, the better screenshot tool</h3>
<p>One of the most important pieces of software you can have is something to capture you display, while <a href="https://github.com/dreamer/scrot">scrot</a> does the job quite well, it has issues with selecting areas and windows, which is where Maim comes in, it does basically the same thing as scrot but without any of the rendering and selection issues. Fun fact, every screenshot you see on this blog was taken using Maim.</p>
